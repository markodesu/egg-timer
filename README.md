# 🍳 Egg Timer App

## The Origin Story

My boyfriend cooked his eggs one too many times and created a culinary disaster. So I did what any loving partner would do—I built him an egg timer app to save him from himself.

## What Is This?

A simple, adorable desktop app that helps you cook eggs to *perfection*. No more burnt scrambled eggs. No more "how long has it been?" panic. Just eggs. Done right.

## Features

✨ **Three Cooking Levels:**
- **Soft** (3 minutes) - Runny yolks, perfectly gooey
- **Medium** (5 minutes) - Golden middle ground
- **Hard** (7 minutes) - Fully cooked, no surprises

🎨 **Beautiful UI with:**
- Floating egg animations (because eggs deserve style)
- Floating menu images (for moral support)
- A welcoming "Let's Cook an Egg" button
- Timer that counts down to perfection

## How to Use

1. Run the app: `python3 app.py`
2. Click "Let's Cook an Egg" to get started
3. Choose your preferred egg doneness
4. Watch the egg float majestically while your timer counts down
5. 🍳 Cook eggs like a pro

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- customtkinter
- Pillow (PIL)

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

## Why This App Exists

Because love means never letting your significant other overcook eggs again. 💕🍳
